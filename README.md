> *Suchana* (सूचना) is Sanskrit for "notice": the notices your apps send you.

suchana is notifications for [Vyom](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vyom): one keyboard-driven panel that opens instantly, with live data, a preview and a key for everything. It runs on any compositor with the layer-shell protocol (sway, Hyprland, river, niri, Wayfire, labwc…). In [Vayu](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vayu), the desktop it was built for, it replaces notification-history.py.

## Features

- What's **on screen now**, with the actions it offers (run them, or dismiss it).
- The history, **grouped by app**, newest first, with each app's icon; urgent ones flagged.
- The preview shows the whole message.
- A **do not disturb** switch (mako's `do-not-disturb` mode, or your own commands).
- Keyboard first: every action has a key, shown in the footer; the mouse works too.
- Never freezes the panel: slow commands run in the background.

## Install

### Requirements

- [Vyom](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vyom) 0.2.5 or newer (Python 3.11+, PyGObject, GTK 4, [gtk4-layer-shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell), a Nerd Font)
- `makoctl`

### Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/suchana ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/suchana
vyom reload           # pick it up (or log out and in)
vyom suchana            # open it; run it again to close
```

Give it a key in your compositor, e.g. sway:

```sh
bindsym $mod+<key> exec vyom suchana
```

### Update and uninstall

```sh
git -C ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/suchana pull && vyom reload     # update
rm -rf ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/suchana && vyom reload          # uninstall
```

## Usage

Open it with `vyom suchana` (or your key). Type to search; the footer always shows the keys for what's selected.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Run the notification's default action, or copy its text |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy the notification's text |
| `Ctrl+Backspace` | Dismiss the on-screen notification |
| `Ctrl+N` | Turn do not disturb on or off |
| `Esc` | Close the panel |

Every Vyom panel also has `Up`/`Down` (or `Ctrl+K`/`Ctrl+J`) to move, `Page Up`/`Page Down` to jump and `Tab` to switch to the next tool.

## Configuration

Everything is optional, in `~/.config/vyom/config.toml` under `[plugin.suchana]`:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `dnd_status` | (makoctl mode) | Command printing the current mode |
| `dnd_on_when` | ^dnd$ | Regex: do not disturb is on |
| `dnd_on / dnd_off` | (makoctl mode -a/-r) | Commands to turn it on / off |

Run `vyom reload` after editing.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing opens.** `vyom list` shows every installed tool, and why one is skipped (a missing requirement, or a Vyom that's too old).
- **It opened, then something failed.** Look for a `Traceback` in `~/.local/state/vyom/daemon.log`, and [open an issue](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/suchana/issues/new/choose) with it.
- **No blur or rounded corners.** That's the compositor: on SwayFX, add `layer_effects "vyom" { blur enable; corner_radius 20; shadows enable }`.
