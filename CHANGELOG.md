# Changelog

Newest first. Releases are tags (`vX.Y.Z`).

## v0.1.4 -- 2026-10-21

- A website (GitHub Pages, https://theyashsawarkar.github.io/suchana/): the README as a home page, the
  changelog, and architecture decision records (`docs/adr/`), built from these files by
  `scripts/build-site.py`; CI checks the site is up to date.

## v0.1.3 -- 2026-10-21

- Documentation for open source: a logo and banner, a full README (features,
  install, usage, configuration, troubleshooting, the whole Vyom family),
  CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY and CODE_OF_CONDUCT, issue and pull request
  templates, and CI (compiles, checks plugin.toml and that every key is
  documented).

## v0.1.2 -- 2026-10-19

- Opens at Vyom's shared panel size (Vyom 0.2.5) like every other tool:
  its own width/height are gone.

## v0.1.1 -- 2026-10-19

- Keys are spelled out (Ctrl+Enter, Shift+Enter, Backspace) instead of symbols
  (⌃↵, ⇧↵, ⌫) in the footer and on rows and buttons.

## v0.1.0 -- 2026-10-19

- First release, as its own repository: notifications. Replaces notification-history.py in Vayu.
- What's **on screen now**, with the actions it offers (run them, or dismiss it).
- The history, **grouped by app**, newest first, with each app's icon; urgent ones flagged.
- The preview shows the whole message.
- A **do not disturb** switch (mako's `do-not-disturb` mode, or your own commands).
